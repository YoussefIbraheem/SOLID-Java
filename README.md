# SOLID-Java

A collection of Java implementations created while studying the **SOLID principles**.  
This repository serves as both a learning journal and a reference for applying clean-code design practices in Java.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project contains hands-on examples demonstrating each SOLID principle:

- **S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- **I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- **D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

Each principle is implemented in its own package with clear examples and simple demonstrations.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:

- Practice writing clean and maintainable Java code  
- Understand how each SOLID principle applies in real-world scenarios  
- Build confidence working with Java packages and class design  
- Create a reference for future projects, interviews, and personal study

## 📂 Project Structure

```

SOLID-Java/
│
├── srp/            # Single Responsibility examples
├── ocp/            # Open/Closed examples
├── lsp/            # Liskov Substitution examples
├── isp/            # Interface Segregation examples
└── dip/            # Dependency Inversion examples

```

Each folder includes:

- A "violation" example (what *not* to do)
- An improved version using the principle correctly
- A small `Main` class for demonstration

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** (beginner → intermediate)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- No external frameworks — pure Java only

---

## 🌱 What I Learned

- How to structure Java projects using packages  
- How to translate SOLID theory into real implementations  
- A deeper understanding of inheritance, composition, and interfaces  
- That Java isn’t the boogeyman I once thought it was 😄  
  (Turns out C++ prepares you for everything.)

## 💡 Next Steps

Potential improvements to the repo:

- Add UML diagrams for each principle  
- Add JUnit tests to validate behavior  
- Add detailed READMEs inside each package

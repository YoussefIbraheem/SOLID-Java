SOLID-Java

A collection of Java implementations created while studying the SOLID principles.
This repository serves as both a learning journal and a reference for applying clean-code design practices in Java.

🚀 Overview

This project contains hands-on examples demonstrating each SOLID principle:

S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each principle is implemented in a dedicated package, with small scenarios showing both “bad” and “improved” versions for comparison.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:

Practice writing clean and maintainable Java code

Understand how each SOLID principle applies in real-world scenarios

Build confidence working with Java packages, classes, and basic project structure

Create a reference for future projects and interviews

Each folder includes:

The initial problem (“violating” example)

The improved solution using proper SOLID design

A simple Main class for testing/demonstration

🛠️ Technologies

Java (beginner–intermediate level)

Basic OOP concepts

No external frameworks (clean, pure Java)

🌱 What I Learned

How to structure Java projects with packages

How to translate theoretical SOLID ideas into working code

How Java’s OOP model compares to languages like C++

That Java is not the boogeyman I once thought it was 😄

💡 Next Steps

Planned enhancements:

Add diagrams or UML for each principle

Add JUnit tests to verify behaviours

Add README pages inside each package explaining the example
